      "metaText":"Kit Slocum, ADHD coach and FLOWN facilitator, explains how she uses tactile visual cues to help her remember things and take the right actions.",
      "londes":"You may have heard of using visual cues to help remember tasks – things like pictures, symbols, or brightly colored sticky notes placed strategically around your environment. These can be useful for remembering important information.However, for folks with ADHD, there's often a heightened chance of inattentional blindness. This means that if something stays in our line of sight for too long, we eventually stop noticing it. It's kind of counterintuitive, but that’s why sticky notes or written visual cues may not always work.If this sounds like you, I encourage you to try using a tactile visual cue. This means you have to physically touch or interact with something in order for the behavior or task to be triggered.If you always forget your keys (like I do), try hanging them over a doorknob or a light switch. That way, when you leave the house or turn off the lights, your hand has to touch the keys – giving you a reminder as you go.If you always forget your keys (like I do), try hanging them over a doorknob or a light switch. That way, when you leave the house or turn off the lights, your hand has to touch the keys – giving you a reminder as you go.You can also combine tactile cues with written reminders. For instance, I use what I call my 'bed sticky' – a sticky note on my pillow or blanket – to help me remember part of my night routine. To get into bed, I have to touch that sticky note, giving me the nudge I need.The key idea here is to physically interact with something to trigger a task.It’s okay if it’s not perfect right away (or ever) – this is just one simple trick I share with my ADHD clients who struggle with traditional visual cues."

      "metaText":"Explore 10 ways virtual coworking helps you stay focused, build routines, and crush goals—all from the comfort of home.",
      "londes":"Working from home is great—no commute, your own coffee, and comfy clothes. But let’s be honest: sometimes, it’s hard to stay focused when there’s nobody around to keep you in check. You might start your day with the best intentions, only to get sidetracked by laundry, social media, or the worst Netflix TV series (*cough cough* Emily in Paris ). If that sounds familiar, virtual coworking might be the productivity solution you never knew you needed. Here are 10 ways that virtual coworking can help you work smarter, stay accountable, and hit your goals like never before.Ever noticed how it’s easier to work out when you’ve got a gym buddy? Virtual coworking works the same way. When you’re working alongside others (even if it’s through a screen), you’re less likely to get distracted. By knowing that other people are there to focus, you feel the same pressure to stay productive.Having a virtual coworking buddy or group can create a powerful effect called “body doubling.” Essentially, just by being “with” someone who’s also working, your mind associates their presence with focus. In virtual coworking, accountability becomes the silent motivator."

      "metaText":"‘Do I have ADHD?’ ‘What should I do to find out?’ Get the rundown on everything you need to know to about ADHD testing, and what to expect when progressing toward an ADHD diagnosis.",
      "londes":"Speaking of ADHD symptoms, though there is a defined set of criteria for the condition in children there is not as strict a set of criteria for adults for ADHD assessments in the UK.There’s no one specific test for diagnosing ADHD in adults. But there is an assessment that a qualified ADHD specialist, whether that’s a psychiatrist or other healthcare professional, performs looking for a set of ADHD symptoms.To get an accurate diagnosis standard ADHD testing usually includes:   -A series of interviews with an appropriate healthcare professional A series of interviews or reports from relevant people in your life such as parents, teachers, friends or partners -A physical examination to rule out any other reasons for your symptoms A standardised behaviour rating scale questionnaire -Diagnostic system checklists.An ADHD diagnosis can only be given if the relevant symptoms have been present since childhood as it’s not currently believed that ADHD can develop in later life. So an ADHD specialist may ask to see evidence from your school days, such as your records, to confirm a diagnosis."

      "metaText":"Delve into the intricacies of procrastination as we unpack the psychology behind it—why we delay, the underlying causes, and strategies to conquer the habit.",
      "londes":"Procrastination is a behavior in which people delay or postpone tasks or actions. Procrastination affects everyone at some point, but understanding its psychology can help you overcome it. Learn about the types of procrastination, their causes, and actionable strategies to boost your productivity.Research has shown that 15-20% of adults procrastinate in a manner that negatively impacts their lives. Procrastination is especially common among college students with 80-95% who procrastinate when it comes to doing their assigned coursework.To understand why people procrastinate it’s important to look at the most common reasons behind the behavior. The reasons will vary from person to person, but there are some very general factors seen in most people who procrastinate routinely.This is in line with the reasons explained by Richard Sima, a neuroscientist turned science journalist. Sima argues that a root of procrastination may be explained by cognitive bias. Procrastinators believe that tasks will magically become easier in the future, rather than doing them now."

      "metaText":"Fear of failure can be incapacitating, let's dig into what causes it, how it might affect you and how to overcome atychiphobia.",
      "londes":"From not accepting an amazing opportunity to procrastinating the day away to protect our sense of self, a fear of failure, and the negative thoughts that come along with it, can stop us in our tracks. Maybe it’s because you’re a perfectionist in every aspect of life, or a particular task scares you. Your fear of failure may also come into play alongside other mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.Most of us will experience a fear of failure at some point in our lives, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Certain projects or tasks may be a stretch for our abilities, and we may procrastinate or have more negative self-talk than usual. But overcoming that fear, managing our mental health needs, and trying our best anyway are important parts of growth. An irrational and persistent fear of failure is a bit more of a problem and can contribute to chronic procrastination. "

      "metaText":"Discover why there’s an Adderall shortage and learn FLOWN’s tips on navigating your ADHD during the shortage",
      "londes":"As of December 2024, there is still an Adderall shortage in the USA, and a growing shortage in the UK with the main medicines affected being Methylphenidate, Lisdexamfetamine, Guanfacine and Atomoxetine. Adderall is made up of two kinds of central nervous stimulants: amphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Because the shortage is a continuing problem, other kinds of ADHD medication, like Methylphenidate alternatives, are also becoming harder to get a hold of.The driving force is thought to be the boom in ADHD diagnoses during the pandemic meaning there’s not enough supply to keep up with demand.Over the pandemic, an unprecedented number of people were diagnosed with ADHD as working and studying from home took away the guardrails people relied on to focus. The government also changed laws around who could diagnose and prescribe medication. For the first time, technology-led health companies (often referred to as telehealth companies) could prescribe ADHD medication over the internet via video consultation. Lots of these telehealth companies started advertising aggressively on social media, diagnosing ADHD frequently and prescribing stimulant medications freely. This was a factor that led to the ADHD medication shortage.  "

      "metaText":"Distractions are everywhere but you can learn to avoid them while boosting your concentration with 10 proven ways to fix your focus.",
      "londes":"Notifications, phone calls, texts, housemates, children… these are just a few of the challenges modern workers can face when it comes to trying to focus at work. In fact, a study by the University of California, found that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to regain your focus after being interrupted. It may seem like a small distraction to check your text or answer an email but what may initially feel like 30 seconds or two minutes, breaks up your productivity 23 minutes at a time.On average, nearly 85.5% of people are distracted at work, commonly disturbed by things like emails, phone calls, and the internet. Even the average worker spends 40 seconds on a single task before switching to something else. This can actually double the amount of time it takes to complete a single project and is part of the reason you can’t focus at work.Beyond the way interruptions impact your ability to complete a task, distractions also significantly increase your stress and the number of errors you may have in the same assignment.We are conditioned to pay attention to changes in our environment and seek out pleasurable activities. For thousands of years our brains kept track of changes in our environment, alerting us to dangerous predators, potential sources of food, or places to shelter. Our instinctual habit to pay attention to distractions as a life saving tool has become a hinderance on our ability to focus in today’s attention economy.Neuroscienstis Daniel J. Levitin says it more succinctly in his book The Organized Mind, “Our brains evolved to focus on one thing at a time.” In the days of inescapable stimulation, every distraction takes us away from our ability to perform our best within Deep Work, pushing our cognitive capabilities. Your environment has become one of constant distraction with these five common concerns attributing to your lack of focus:"

      "metaText":"Dip into our comprehensive guide to body doubling, and learn practical tips on how to use it to stop procrastinating, spark focus, and make productivity easy.",
      "londes":"I’ll admit when I first heard the term body doubling I too began conjuring images of mannequins and stuntmen. But through running countless body doubling sessions and tons of research, I’ve discovered it to be one of the most powerful work hacks out there.If you’ve ever found yourself buried in emails and Slack pings, only to reach the end of the day with your major projects still staring you down, body doubling may be just what you need.So, keep reading to discover everything you need to know about what body doubling is, how to do it, and how you can use it to kiss burnout goodbye and transform your daily grind into a flow of productive success.Body doubling is a term used to describe the practice of performing a task with someone else present. Sounds simple, yet works like a charm when it comes to staving off procrastination to concentrate on your tasks.As a productivity coach, I’ve seen firsthand how body doubling can help folks get kickstarted with their meatiest projects. Which is why I always talk about its benefits, whether consulting with businesses or delivering talks to students and faculty at places like Oxford University.The term ‘body doubling’ was first coined in 1996 by Linda Anderson, an executive productivity coach who later became popular among the ADHD community.However the true origins of body doubling go all the way back to the play theorists of the early 20th century. Back then you had the likes of Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Mildred Parten and others exploring the psychology of learning and play among children.Parten observed that when young children played independently alongside one another — a phenomenon known as parallel play —  they’d continue playing for far longer than when playing alone.Through her work with ADHD clients, Anderson discovered this same phenomenon to be apparent among adults."
